        <p>While growing up I was an ok student. Junior High I maintained a 3.0+ gpa for both years, but once I started High School I just stopped trying.</p>
        <p>Freshman year made me realized that I had to put in effort, and to take school seriously if I want to have a good life.</p>
        <h3 class="section">Future</h3>
        <p>I want to go to California State University Long Beach cause of their volleyball team and their great computer classes. Another school I want to go to is Cal Poly Ponona.</p>
